# User Authentication Demo Using URLSession

## Setup
1. For the code to work, you must first install MySQL on your Mac from https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/.
2. Create a new database called 'demo', and create a new table within it called 'users'. The table should have two entries, 'username' and 'password'.
3. Setup localhost web hosting on your Mac. A good tutorial is https://websitebeaver.com/set-up-localhost-on-macos-high-sierra-apache-mysql-and-php-7-with-sslhttps.
4. Place 'login.php' in your ~/Sites folder, and replace the root password with your root password for MySQL.
5. The demo app should function. To make it fun, go to the 'users' table and add a few users.
